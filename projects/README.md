# NFCards
## Summary
##### Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do?
An LED NFC (Near Field Communication) Card that replaces paper cards to network

## Plan
##### How much is it going to cost? What's your timeline?

The total cost is around 82 dollars, before shipping. I plan to test and use my projects as soon as possible, following their delivery.

## Design
##### Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional**

This is my first time designing a PCB. Luckily, I found an NFC Business Card tutorial by a fellow Hack Clubber, Maggie, to be very helpful, inspiring, and educational. 

I initially began following her tutorial steps, though I ended up playing around a bit, tinkering with personalization.

I found this to be an enjoyable learning experience that I will remember for years to come.
